		<h1>Company News</h1>
		<p>As our clientele continues to grow, as do our stores. We have recently begun opening stores in Texas, as this was a big market for our online services. There are stores in Houston, San Antonio, Dallas, Austin, and Arlington as of right now, and there are plans to continue making more. If you don't have a store near you and you would like one, let us know via email.</p>

		<p>We have also expanded our game selection to include games for the Nintendo Switch. There has been much demand for this, and we are here to serve the customer. These games can now be bought in many of our stores, as well as on our online order forms.</p>

		<p>We became a company on August 31, 2017 in the midst of a gaming storm. Our main purpose is to fulfill the needs of gamers nationwide, and eventually worldwide</p>
